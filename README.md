# Holberton Headphones
In this project, we implement from scratch a web page, using HTML/CSS/Accessibility and Responsive design.
This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer, from figma we got access to all design details.

## Sections
For better results the project was divided by sections as:
- Header
- What we do...
- Our results
- Contact us
- Footer

Each section was written in a respective index and styles-sheet.
